<br>

I write code no matter what I do. If I'm writing music, doing design, video, or just doing routine work I write scripts or even entire tools to simplify my work. I like it

I have experience in developing and writing scripts and tools of different complexity in different languages (Javascript: After Effects, Figma, Illustrator, Studio One, Lua: Reaper, AHK: windows automation, etc.)
